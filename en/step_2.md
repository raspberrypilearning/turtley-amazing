Have a look at the image below. How would you describe it? Is is art, maths, or computer science?

It's a computer-generated image, but making it requires an understanding of art, maths, and computer science. Let's see how you too can make images just like this.

## Drawing a line

The image above is made up of lines and only lines! To get started, you need to know how to draw a line using a little bit of Python code. 

<div style="display: flex; flex-wrap: wrap">
  <div style="flex-basis: 175px; flex-grow: 1">
    Click on the <strong>Run</strong> button to run the program. Change the number and see what happens 
    
  </div>
  <div class="trinket">
    <iframe 
      src="https://editor.raspberrypi.org/en/embed/viewer/starter-turtley-amazing" 
      width="600" 
      height="600" 
      frameborder="0" 
      marginwidth="0" 
      marginheight="0" 
      allowfullscreen>
    </iframe>
  </div>
</div>
Notes:


- Click on **Run** ![arrow](images/arrow.png) to see the code working.
- Now try changing the number in the line `turtle.forward(100)`, click on **Run** ![arrow](images/arrow.png) again and see what happens.
