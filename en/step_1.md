## What you will do
In this resource you will take your first steps with the programming language Python to draw shapes, patterns, and spirals. You will use a module named Turtle. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, and use loops to repeat a sequence. This is a great stepping stone from a visual programming language like Scratch to the text-based environment of Python. 

Youâ€™re about to make your screen explode with colour! Grab your turtle and:

- Draw epic lines that zig, zag, and swirl
- Make wild turns to build cool shapes
- Switch pen colours whenever you feel like it
- Use loops to grow awesome patterns
- Stack loops inside loops to unlock crazy spirals
