## Enormous lists

You can now have a go at creating a list of colours that's a little longer than before. To do this you can use a `while` loop. Unlike a `for` loop, a `while` loop keeps running until a specific condition has been met.

- Look at the code below. The `while` loop is used to gradually increase the value of `G` until it reaches 255. Each time, the colours are added to the list.

- Can you add in two more `while` loops to add more colours? The next loop should gradually decrease `R` until it reaches 0. The final one should then increase `B` until it reaches 255. Have a go, but if you get stuck, all will be revealed in the last section.
