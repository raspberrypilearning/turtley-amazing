## Wat ga je maken?

In this resource you will take your first steps with the programming language Python to draw shapes, patterns, and spirals. You will use a module named Turtle. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, and use loops to repeat a sequence. This is a great stepping stone from a visual programming language like Scratch to the text-based environment of Python.

## Wat ga je leren

By making patterns with Python code you will learn:

- To take your first steps with the Python programming language
- How to draw lines with Python Turtle
- How to make turns
- How to change the pen colour
- To use loops to repeat some instructions and create shapes
- To use more loops to create spiral patterns
