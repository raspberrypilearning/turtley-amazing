## 만들 작품

In this resource you will take your first steps with the programming language Python to draw shapes, patterns, and spirals. You will use a module named Turtle. Along the way you will learn how to think in sequences, and use loops to repeat a sequence. This is a great stepping stone from a visual programming language like Scratch to the text-based environment of Python.
